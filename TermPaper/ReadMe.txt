For every website there is a necessity of domain to access the website i.e,(example :https://google.com).
To migrate this website to new or other existing domain, it is difficult because it can crash the site or cut the traffic or change site`s usability. 
Website migration will resolve above problem in minimal time and provides a solution.

REST attempts to describe architectures that use HTTP or similar protocols by constraining the interface to a set of well-known, 
It mainly focus on interacting with stateless resources rather than messages or operations.
