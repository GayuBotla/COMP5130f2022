 To migrate a website to new or other existing domain, it is difficult because it can crash the site or cut the traffic or change siteâ€™s usability. Website migration will resolve above problem in minimal time. It makes the site available all the time without any change in site's structure, performance or traffic. To make website migration successful, we need to follow certain steps. This include following REST services (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for HTTP). Clean URLs are tightly associated with the REST concept..
